--- Interaction 1 ---
 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The development tasks for a product are the engineering work required to develop the product. Each task is associated with a specific user story and represents a specific piece of work that needs to be completed to implement the functionality described in the story.
Worker Agent Response:
That's correct! Development tasks are essentially the engineering work needed to bring a product to life. Each task is linked to a user story and outlines a specific job that must be done to make the functionality described in the story a reality.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No. The answer provided does not follow the exact structure of Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies. It provides a general explanation of development tasks without specific examples following the required structure.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, follow these steps:

1. Start by organizing the information in the correct order: Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies.

2. For each task, provide specific examples that follow the required structure. Include details such as task titles, related user stories, descriptions of the task, acceptance criteria, estimated effort in hours or days, and any dependencies that may impact the task.

3. Make sure to be clear and concise in your explanations, providing enough detail for someone to understand the task without being overly verbose.

4. Review the answer to ensure that it follows the correct structure and includes all necessary information for each task. Make any necessary revisions to ensure clarity and accuracy.
 Step 5: Send feedback to worker agent for refinement
